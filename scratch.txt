We would like to offer the opportunity to complete the following coding tests. Successful completion comes with a $50 bonus:

Building a real-time chat application using Python, Django, and Redis.

The application should allow users to send and receive messages in real-time, using a technology such as WebSockets.
The application should be built using Python, Django and should include proper routing, error handling and form validation
The application should use Redis to implement real-time functionality, so all part about messages should be stored both in Redis (for fast response), not in a database (in case someone refresh page or add to the conversation, you will need to retrieve all messages for that conversation).
Use a database (PostgresSQL/MySQL) to manage users, and maybe conversation ids.
The application should include proper logging and monitoring.

Considerations:

API URL structure is up to you.
Initial data for sign up: name, last name, email.
Validation rules for signup data are up to you.
Json structure is up to you.
It will be a big plus if you deploy the services somewhere in the cloud (heroku, gcloud, aws, azure, etc). It's ok if you just do it locally, but use docker.
Use github (or other git repo). It's a big plus to include github actions.
Do tests and integrations tests.

Programming language: Python.
BONUS: If you can implement API throttling for messages in real time, that's a big one. Throttling rules are up to you (1 API call per second allowed or 10 API calls per minute, etc).
Log every API call received, log format is up to you.
Place a README.md file with instructions in the github repo so test can be performed and checked.
